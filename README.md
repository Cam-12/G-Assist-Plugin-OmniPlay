# OmniPlay Plugin for NVIDIA G-Assist
OmniPlay is a G-Assist plugin that enriches the gaming experience with two main features:
1. 🎮 In-game note-taking
Players can record personal notes on the fly as they play.
2. 🔍 Game information search
OmniPlay can provide contextual descriptions about :
- characters
- missions
- story or lore
- specific game elements

It automatically queries community wikis such as Fandom and wiki.gg, with a fallback search system if no direct info is found.
